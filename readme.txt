=============================

Ohno is a tool primarily for fanlisting permanent trouble checkers to
easily create lists for the fanlistings they make trouble checks for, although
it can track lists of any kind that you need to keep tabs on. Checking for
broken links in a clique you own? Verifying submission entries? OhNo can do
what you need it to do.
